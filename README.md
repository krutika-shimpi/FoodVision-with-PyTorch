## Project Description: Deployment of FoodVision Model Using Gradio

Our objective is to deploy the FoodVision Model through a Gradio application, ensuring high performance and real-time responsiveness. The key metrics for this deployment are:

**Performance:** Achieve an accuracy of 95% or higher.
**Speed:** Attain real-time inference with 30 FPS or more, ensuring a latency of less than approximately 0.03 seconds per prediction.

To achieve these objectives, we will conduct an experiment to compare our two leading models: EfficientNetB2 (EffNetB2) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature extractors. The model that best aligns with our performance and speed criteria will be selected for deployment via a Gradio demo, followed by a significant enhancement.

### Project Phases:

* **Setup:** Download and prepare the necessary code from previous phases to facilitate a smooth continuation of the project.
* **Data Acquisition:** Obtain the pizza_steak_sushi_20_percent.zip dataset to ensure consistent training for both models.
* **Experiment Outline:** Design and execute experiments to evaluate the performance of EffNetB2 and ViT in relation to our target metrics.
* **EffNetB2 Feature Extractor Development:** Rebuild the EfficientNetB2 feature extractor that demonstrated superior performance in earlier tests, preparing it as a candidate for deployment.
* **ViT Feature Extractor Development:** Recreate the Vision Transformer feature extractor, which has previously shown strong results, as an alternative candidate for deployment.
* **Model Evaluation:** Perform predictions with both models, measure their performance, and assess their efficiency in meeting our goals.
* **Model Comparison:** Analyze the results to determine which model aligns more closely with our performance and speed objectives.
* **Gradio Demo Development:** Create a Gradio demo application for the selected model to demonstrate its functionality and effectiveness.
* **Deployment Preparation:** Convert the Gradio demo into a deployable application, ensuring it is optimized for production use.
* **HuggingFace Spaces Deployment:** Deploy the FoodVision Mini application to HuggingFace Spaces, making it accessible to the public.
* **Surprise Enhancement:** Develop and integrate a major enhancement to elevate the project beyond the initial deployment.
* **Final Deployment:** Deploy the enhanced feature or application, further advancing the projectâ€™s capabilities.

This project will transition from model evaluation to a publicly accessible application, culminating in an exciting final enhancement. Your engagement in this process will contribute to the successful deployment and innovation of the FoodVision Model.
